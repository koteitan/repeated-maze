# Minsky Doubling Machine

Encodes a 2-counter Minsky register machine on the repeated maze. Each doubling cycle computes `y ↦ 2y + 1` using the x-register as temporary storage. After k cycles the path length grows as O(2^k), which is exponential in nterm since nterm = 12k + 3.

The maze uses x-motion (W→E / E→W ports) for register x, y-motion (S→N / N→S ports) for register y, and boundary blocks (nx at x=0, ny at y=0) for zero-testing branches.

## Examples

- [k=5](5.md) — 5 doubling cycles, nterm=61, path length 662
