# runhs — Haskell state machine runner

`runhs.py` executes a Haskell source file written in the
`hs2maze` / `nd-to-2d` input format.  Those files define a single
tail-recursive step function (e.g. `cp3 (x, y, z, pc) = cp3 (...)`) and
do not include a `main :: IO ()`, so they cannot be handed to `runghc`
directly.  `runhs.py` rewrites each equation into a one-step form,
adds a pc=1 terminator, wraps it with a `main` driver, and invokes
`runghc` on the resulting temp file.

## Usage

```bash
python3 runhs.py FILE.hs             # print HALT step count and state
python3 runhs.py FILE.hs --trace     # also print every intermediate state
python3 runhs.py FILE.hs --limit N   # abort if the step count exceeds N
                                     # (default: 5_000_000)
python3 runhs.py FILE.hs --save      # keep the wrapped Haskell beside the
                                     # input as <stem>_runable.hs
```

## Supported input

The input file must contain equations of the form

```haskell
FN (pat_0, ..., pat_{n-1}, pat_pc) = FN (rhs_0, ..., rhs_{n-1}, rhs_pc)
```

and optionally a type signature like

```haskell
FN :: (Int, ..., Int) -> (Int, ..., Int)
```

The tuple arity (*n* + 1 slots, the last being the program counter) is
inferred from the signature or from the first equation.  Any arity
≥ 2 is accepted, so both the *n*-register source (fed to `nd-to-2d`)
and the 2-register Gödel output (fed to `hs2maze`) can be executed.

## Initial state and HALT

The driver starts the step function at

- arity 2: `(0, 0)`
- arity 3: `(0, 1, 0)` — the hs2maze canonical initial state
- arity ≥ 4: `(0, 1, 0, ..., 0, 0)` — x=0, y=1, rest=0, pc=0

and stops when the program counter (last slot) equals 1, printing
`HALT <step> <state>`.  If the driver exceeds `--limit` steps it
instead prints `TIMEOUT <step> <state>`.

## Example

```bash
$ python3 tools/runhs/runhs.py maze/counter-pump/cp2-4.hs
HALT 48 (0,0,1)

$ python3 tools/runhs/runhs.py maze/counter-pump/cp2-4.hs --trace | head -4
0 (0,1,0)
1 (0,0,2)
2 (1,0,3)
3 (2,0,4)
```
