# Repeated Maze

Find the maze configurations that maximize the shortest path length, analogous to the Busy Beaver problem for Turing machines but applied to register machines on repeated tile mazes.

## Overview

A "repeated maze" consists of identical blocks tiled across an infinite 2D grid. Each block has terminals (ports) on its four sides that connect to adjacent blocks. A player navigates from a start state to a goal state through these port connections. The challenge is to find the maze configuration (port assignment) that maximizes the length of the shortest path.

The **main UI** is the browser-based viewer/solver [`index.html`](index.html). Paste a maze string for interactive visualization and solving. From the CLI, the new **atomic-port (*1) maze format** emitted by `hs2maze.py` (with `C` subterminals, the `zero` block type, and `W0-C0` / `C1-W1` bridges) is solved by the Python [solver.py](tools/solver/README.md).

The **maze generator search** that maximizes shortest path length for a given nterm lives at [tools/gen-maze](tools/gen-maze) (C implementation, three strategies: exhaustive enumeration, random sampling, top-down pruning). It is legacy-format only — (*1) mazes are not supported there.

## Visualization (main UI)

Open `index.html` in a browser to visualize and solve mazes interactively.
Both the new (atomic-port (*1)) and the legacy formats are accepted.

## CLI solver (new format)

```bash
python3 tools/solver/solver.py FILE.maze
```

See [tools/solver/README.md](tools/solver/README.md) for details.

## Maze generator search (legacy format only)

Build and run the C implementation under `tools/gen-maze/`:

```bash
cd tools/gen-maze && make

# Solve a maze
./repeated-maze solve '<maze_string>' [--bfs] [-v]

# Exhaustive search
./repeated-maze search <nterm> --max-aport <N> [--min-aport <N>] [--max-len <N>] [--random <seed>] [--bfs] [-v]

# Top-down search
./repeated-maze search <nterm> --topdown [--max-len <N>] [--bfs] [-v]

# Normalize a maze
./repeated-maze norm <nterm> '<maze_string>'
```
