/*
 * solver.h -- IDDFS solver for finding the shortest path in a repeated maze.
 *
 * The solver uses a canonical state representation where each state is
 * a 4-tuple (x, y, dir, idx):
 *   - (x, y) is a grid position (x >= 0, y >= 0)
 *   - dir is the canonical direction: E (=0) or N (=1)
 *   - idx is the terminal index (0..nterm-1)
 *
 * Canonicalization collapses W/S terminals into E/N using the identity:
 *   W[n] @ (bx, by) = E[n] @ (bx-1, by) -> canonical (bx-1, by, E, n)
 *   S[n] @ (bx, by) = N[n] @ (bx, by-1) -> canonical (bx, by-1, N, n)
 *
 * This halves the state space and simplifies the transition function.
 *
 * Initial state: W[0] @ (1,1) = canonical (0, 1, E, 0)
 * Goal state:    W[1] @ (1,1) = canonical (0, 1, E, 1)

 * State -- a canonical state in the infinite grid.

 * Fields:
 *   x, y -- grid coordinates (>= 0). The state represents a physical point
 *           at the boundary between adjacent blocks.
 *   dir  -- canonical direction: CDIR_E (east boundary) or CDIR_N (north boundary)
 *   idx  -- terminal index (0..nterm-1)
 *
 * A state (x, y, E, i) is the physical point shared by:
 *   - E[i] terminal of block (x, y) [if valid block]
 *   - W[i] terminal of block (x+1, y) [if valid block]
 *
 * A state (x, y, N, i) is the physical point shared by:
 *   - N[i] terminal of block (x, y) [if valid block]
 *   - S[i] terminal of block (x, y+1) [if valid block]
